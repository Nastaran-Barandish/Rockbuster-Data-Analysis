# Rockbuster Data Analysis
## Project Summary
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a former global movie rental company, is pivoting to an online video rental service to stay competitive against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. As a data analyst in the Business Intelligence (BI) department, your role is to load Rockbuster’s data into a relational database (RDBMS), analyze it using SQL, and provide insights to various departments. Your findings will help shape the company's strategy and be presented to the management board in an easy-to-digest format. Key business questions include revenue contributions of films, rental duration, customer demographics, and geographic sales trends. Ultimately, your analysis will aid in Rockbuster’s transition to the digital market.

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
